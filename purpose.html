            <ul>
                There is limitless value to hearing from and analyzing a multitude of perspectives. There continues to exist discrepancies for students in their educational experiences, especially for those identifying with marginalized communities. Through these narratives, we better recognize the unique and specific issues faced by a variety of students, as well as actions that can be taken to mitigate these hardships. By promoting diversity and inclusion, educational programs are enriched and grow in their ability to advocate for all students.

            The Archive Project is led by Dr. Rachael Cate, an EECS faculty member at Oregon State University dedicated to social justice and reform. Under her leadership, we have been honored to collect a series of narratives, shared on this website. These narratives tell the life stories of a diverse population of students within the engineering department of OSU. These students share unique cultures, triumphs, hardships, skills, and values that they hold as a result of their past and present experiences. It is only through these students that this project is made possible, enabling all of us to grow our perspectives and create positive change within our communities.
