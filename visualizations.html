                By collecting the key terms used by each individual 
                during their interview, we are able to get a general 
                sense of the common values and areas of importance to 
                individuals in marginalized communities.

                  Our process flow chart depicts the ways in which the 
                  research project is conducted.  By interviewing 
                  individuals of often underserved communities and 
                  analyzing the trends seen in these interviews, we 
                  can present these results to hopefully create 
                  positive change within the OSU engineering 
                  community and beyond.
